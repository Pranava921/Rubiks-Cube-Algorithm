**2D Rubik's Cube Solver Algorithm**

This Project is a 2D Rubik's Cube Solver built using Javascript and object-orientation programming concepts, including the features:

**How it Works**

**Scramble Functionality** : Scrambles the cube randomly on clicking Scramble Button.  
**Manual Keys**: User can rotate faces either to scramble manually or to solve scrambled cube using the provided buttons for clockwise(CW) and counter-clockwise(CCW) moves.  
**Auto-Solution**: Solves the cube automatically when user gives up on clicking the solve button using the reverse move logic, even after manual moves.  
**History and Reverse Algorithm**: Tracks and reverse the moves utilising the storage of 'history' and 'manualMoves' to solve the cube.  
**Visual Effects**: A flat 2D Rubik's Cube with SVG rectangle colored components face.  
**Pure Javascript Functionality** with no External Librabries.  

Technologies and Tools:
-HTML5
-CSS3
-JavaScript(ES6)
-SVG for 2D Cube Visualization
-Visual Studio Code

**To Run**
1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Use the buttons to:
   - Scramble the cube
   - Rotate any face manually
   - Solve the cube using tracked steps
